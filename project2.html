							<p>This project involved designing and implementing a Traffic Light Controller (TLC) using a synchronous state machine architecture. The controller operated at a fixed 1 Hz cycle, ensuring accurate timing for predictable light changes in line with real-world requirements. To enhance functionality, pedestrian input signals were integrated, allowing users to request crossing changes that were queued until the appropriate point in the cycle. The design emphasized reliability and determinism by using a global clock to eliminate metastability issues, making the system both robust and practical for traffic management scenarios.</p>
							<p>For output visualization, the LogicalStep boardâ€™s seven-segment displays were repurposed to represent traffic light states. The top, center, and bottom segments were mapped to red, amber, and green lights respectively, simulating the behavior of an actual traffic light column. By sequencing through the state machine, the system illuminated the correct segments based on timing and pedestrian requests. This project not only demonstrated digital design concepts like synchronous sequential logic and state machine modeling but also showcased a creative approach to hardware limitations through clever use of available display components.</p>
